This directory tree holds version 0.9 of JParse, a parser for Java
source programs.  JParse itself is written in Java, so it will run on
any platform with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).  However, it will only
work with JDK 1.2 or later.  JParse produces an abstract syntax tree
from a Java source file, and gives the ability to query expressions for
their types, and expressions, statements, and methods for the checked
exceptions they throw.

JParse uses ANTLR to create the lexer, parser, and abstract syntax tree
walkers that is uses.  See http://www.antlr.org/ for more information on
ANTLR.

The file `INSTALL' in this directory gives information on building and
installing JParse.

Reports of bugs in JParse should be sent to the JParse maintainer.  The
maintainer is currently Jerry James <jamesj@acm.org>.  See the file
`BUGS' in this directory for a list of known bugs in the current
version.

The JParse home page is http://www.ittc.ku.edu/JParse/.  Updates,
bugfixes, and further documentation will appear there from time to
time.
