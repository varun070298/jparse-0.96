If you think you may have found a bug in JParse, please report it to the
JParse maintainer.  The maintainer is currently:

Jerry James <jamesj@acm.org>


Known bugs in JParse:

1) Syntax errors in a source file cause JParse to emit cryptic error
   messages.

2) Semantic errors in a source file cause JParse to crash with an
   exception in some JParse class, or in some rare cases to appear to
   proceed normally, but give incorrect results when queried for type or
   exception information.

When bugs #1-2 have been fixed, JParse 1.0 will be released.
