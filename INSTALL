BUILDING:

JParse is distributed in pre-built form, so you only need to build it if
you want to use your fancy optimizing Java compiler to produce more
efficient class files, you want to make changes to the source and
rebuild it afterward, or you want to use a newer version of ANTLR.  If
you just want to install, skip to the section on INSTALLATION below.

1) Make sure that the ANTLR classes are in your CLASSPATH.  This version
   of JParse requires at least version 2.7.3 of ANTLR.

2) Unpack the jparse.jar file.  This will create a directory named "jparse"
   that contains all of the source files.  Issue a `cd jparse' command
   to change to that directory.

3) Modify the Makefile in the jparse directory as directed by the
   comments therein.  In particular, specify the Java compiler, Java
   documentation generator, and Java archive tool to use.  The defaults
   are "javac", "javadoc", and "jar", respectively.

4) Run the `make' command in the jparse directory.  This will invoke
   ANTLR to generate the lexer, parser, and tree walkers used by JParse,
   then invoke the Java compiler to produce class files.  If you want a
   version of JParse that supports debugging, run the `make debug'
   command instead.

5) Run the `make jar' command to rebuild the JParse JAR file.


INSTALLATION:

To install, simply set your CLASSPATH to include the ANTLR and JParse
jar files.  For example, if I put antlr.jar and jparse.jar in
/usr/local/classes, I would modify my CLASSPATH as follows:

(If using csh or tcsh):
setenv CLASSPATH ${CLASSPATH}:/usr/local/classes/antlr.jar:/usr/local/classes/jparse.jar

(If using sh, ksh, or bash):
CLASSPATH=$CLASSPATH:/usr/local/classes/antlr.jar:/usr/local/classes/jparse.jar
export CLASSPATH

And that's all!
